# Agent Guidance

## Testing Expectations

When new functionality is added, add tests for the behavior that is actually registered, reachable, and intended to be used by the current product. Do not add active coverage for scaffold routes, commented-out routes, future product decisions, or infrastructure that does not exist yet. Put those items in `TODO.md` under a future development or product review section instead.

For new or changed routes, cover the full behavioral boundary:

- the successful request for the intended user role
- unauthenticated access when the route is protected
- organization access boundaries for organization-scoped routes
- super-admin behavior when the current feature supports it
- validation failures for required fields and invalid foreign keys
- side effects in the database, storage, mail, queue, HTTP client, and logs
- token, secret, and sensitive-data handling when auth or integrations are involved

For organization-scoped resources, include same-organization and cross-organization assertions. Route model binding alone is not enough unless the route is explicitly scoped and the test proves the boundary.

For auth and user administration, include tests for token lifecycle, role boundaries, invitation lifecycle, and deletion behavior. If a hardening rule has not been implemented yet, document it in `TODO.md` as development work rather than writing a skipped or speculative active test.

## Test Naming

Use precise test names that describe exactly what is being checked. Avoid broad names such as `cannot_access_admin_routes` when the test only covers one route family. Prefer names like `editors_cannot_access_the_rates_sync_key_route` or `rate_batch_rejects_a_rate_group_from_another_organization`.

When a test intentionally documents a removed or deferred legacy behavior, keep a skipped stub only if it provides useful chain of custody. The skip message should explain why the behavior is not active coverage.

## Coverage Conventions

Feature tests should exercise HTTP endpoints through the real route and middleware stack whenever possible. Unit tests are appropriate for isolated service behavior, model behavior, or jobs that can be tested without routing.

Keep public endpoint tests separate from authenticated editing/admin tests. Public rates, authenticated rate editing, rate group lifecycle, sync key administration, CSV parsing, organization administration, invitations, users, security boundaries, and smoke coverage each have their own test classes.

Smoke tests should verify that active product route signatures are registered and that representative requests do not produce server errors. They are not a substitute for feature-specific assertions.

Use explicit database assertions for ownership and side effects. For soft-deleted records, assert soft deletion rather than only checking response status. For streamed CSV responses, inspect the streamed content and verify draft or cross-organization data is absent.

## Current Testing Patterns

Use `actingAs($user, 'sanctum')` for authenticated API requests. Public endpoints should be called without authentication unless the route is intentionally protected.

Use fakes for external side effects:

- `Mail::fake()` for invitation emails
- `Queue::fake()` when a request would dispatch website sync jobs
- `Storage::fake()` for file and CSV tests
- `Http::fake()` for webhook calls
- a local `UncompromisedVerifier` binding when password validation would otherwise call an external uncompromised-password service

When testing logs around webhooks or secrets, assert that sensitive values are not present in the logged context.

Tests run against SQLite in memory via `phpunit.xml`. Do not rely on MySQL-only behavior unless the test explicitly documents that gap.

Factories are not always available for older scaffold domains. Prefer using existing factories when present, but direct model creation is acceptable in tests when it is clearer and matches current local patterns.

## TODO Discipline

Keep `TODO.md` accurate:

- `Existing Active Coverage` should list only tests that exist and behavior they actually assert.
- `Laravel 10 Migration-Critical Remaining Coverage` should include only coverage needed to make the framework upgrade safe.
- product decisions, scaffold routes, audit logging, role-policy changes, expiration rules, and other unimplemented behavior belong in separate action-item sections.

When adding tests, update `TODO.md` in the same change so the coverage inventory stays aligned with the suite.

## Useful Commands

Run focused tests while developing:

```bash
vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Feature/Rates/RateEditingEndpointsTest.php
```

Run the full suite before migration or dependency work:

```bash
vendor/bin/phpunit
```

# Laravel Boost Guidelines

The Laravel Boost guidelines are specifically curated by Laravel maintainers for this application. These guidelines should be followed closely to ensure the best experience when building Laravel applications.

## Foundational Context

This application is a Laravel application and its main Laravel ecosystems package & versions are below. You are an expert with them all. Ensure you abide by these specific packages & versions.

- php - 8.2
- laravel/cashier (CASHIER) - v15
- laravel/framework (LARAVEL) - v12
- laravel/prompts (PROMPTS) - v0
- laravel/sanctum (SANCTUM) - v4
- laravel/boost (BOOST) - v2
- laravel/mcp (MCP) - v0
- laravel/sail (SAIL) - v1
- phpunit/phpunit (PHPUNIT) - v11

## Skills Activation

This project has domain-specific skills available in `**/skills/**`. You MUST activate the relevant skill whenever you work in that domain—don't wait until you're stuck.

## Conventions

- You must follow all existing code conventions used in this application. When creating or editing a file, check sibling files for the correct structure, approach, and naming.
- Use descriptive names for variables and methods. For example, `isRegisteredForDiscounts`, not `discount()`.
- Check for existing components to reuse before writing a new one.

## Verification Scripts

- Do not create verification scripts or tinker when tests cover that functionality and prove they work. Unit and feature tests are more important.

## Application Structure & Architecture

- Stick to existing directory structure; don't create new base folders without approval.
- Do not change the application's dependencies without approval.

## Frontend Bundling

- If the user doesn't see a frontend change reflected in the UI, it could mean they need to run `npm run build`, `npm run dev`, or `composer run dev`. Ask them.

## Documentation Files

- You must only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the user.

## Replies

- Be concise in your explanations - focus on what's important rather than explaining obvious details.

=== boost rules ===

# Laravel Boost

## Tools

- Laravel Boost is an MCP server with tools designed specifically for this application. Prefer Boost tools over manual alternatives like shell commands or file reads.
- Use `database-query` to run read-only queries against the database instead of writing raw SQL in tinker.
- Use `database-schema` to inspect table structure before writing migrations or models.
- Use `get-absolute-url` to resolve the correct scheme, domain, and port for project URLs. Always use this before sharing a URL with the user.
- Use `browser-logs` to read browser logs, errors, and exceptions. Only recent logs are useful, ignore old entries.

## Searching Documentation (IMPORTANT)

- Always use `search-docs` before making code changes. Do not skip this step. It returns version-specific docs based on installed packages automatically.
- Pass a `packages` array to scope results when you know which packages are relevant.
- Use multiple broad, topic-based queries: `['rate limiting', 'routing rate limiting', 'routing']`. Expect the most relevant results first.
- Do not add package names to queries because package info is already shared. Use `test resource table`, not `filament 4 test resource table`.

### Search Syntax

1. Use words for auto-stemmed AND logic: `rate limit` matches both "rate" AND "limit".
2. Use `"quoted phrases"` for exact position matching: `"infinite scroll"` requires adjacent words in order.
3. Combine words and phrases for mixed queries: `middleware "rate limit"`.
4. Use multiple queries for OR logic: `queries=["authentication", "middleware"]`.

## Artisan

- Run Artisan commands directly via the command line (e.g., `php artisan route:list`). Use `php artisan list` to discover available commands and `php artisan [command] --help` to check parameters.
- Inspect routes with `php artisan route:list`. Filter with: `--method=GET`, `--name=users`, `--path=api`, `--except-vendor`, `--only-vendor`.
- Read configuration values using dot notation: `php artisan config:show app.name`, `php artisan config:show database.default`. Or read config files directly from the `config/` directory.

## Tinker

- Execute PHP in app context for debugging and testing code. Do not create models without user approval, prefer tests with factories instead. Prefer existing Artisan commands over custom tinker code.
- Always use single quotes to prevent shell expansion: `php artisan tinker --execute 'Your::code();'`
  - Double quotes for PHP strings inside: `php artisan tinker --execute 'User::where("active", true)->count();'`

=== php rules ===

# PHP

- Always use curly braces for control structures, even for single-line bodies.
- Use PHP 8 constructor property promotion: `public function __construct(public GitHub $github) { }`. Do not leave empty zero-parameter `__construct()` methods unless the constructor is private.
- Use explicit return type declarations and type hints for all method parameters: `function isAccessible(User $user, ?string $path = null): bool`
- Follow existing application Enum naming conventions.
- Prefer PHPDoc blocks over inline comments. Only add inline comments for exceptionally complex logic.
- Use array shape type definitions in PHPDoc blocks.

=== deployments rules ===

# Deployment

- Laravel can be deployed using [Laravel Cloud](https://cloud.laravel.com/), which is the fastest way to deploy and scale production Laravel applications.

=== tests rules ===

# Test Enforcement

- Every change must be programmatically tested. Write a new test or update an existing test, then run the affected tests to make sure they pass.
- Run the minimum number of tests needed to ensure code quality and speed. Use `php artisan test --compact` with a specific filename or filter.

=== laravel/core rules ===

# Do Things the Laravel Way

- Use `php artisan make:` commands to create new files (i.e. migrations, controllers, models, etc.). You can list available Artisan commands using `php artisan list` and check their parameters with `php artisan [command] --help`.
- If you're creating a generic PHP class, use `php artisan make:class`.
- Pass `--no-interaction` to all Artisan commands to ensure they work without user input. You should also pass the correct `--options` to ensure correct behavior.

### Model Creation

- When creating new models, create useful factories and seeders for them too. Ask the user if they need any other things, using `php artisan make:model --help` to check the available options.

## APIs & Eloquent Resources

- For APIs, default to using Eloquent API Resources and API versioning unless existing API routes do not, then you should follow existing application convention.

## URL Generation

- When generating links to other pages, prefer named routes and the `route()` function.

## Testing

- When creating models for tests, use the factories for the models. Check if the factory has custom states that can be used before manually setting up the model.
- Faker: Use methods such as `$this->faker->word()` or `fake()->randomDigit()`. Follow existing conventions whether to use `$this->faker` or `fake()`.
- When creating tests, make use of `php artisan make:test [options] {name}` to create a feature test, and pass `--unit` to create a unit test. Most tests should be feature tests.

## Vite Error

- If you receive an "Illuminate\Foundation\ViteException: Unable to locate file in Vite manifest" error, you can run `npm run build` or ask the user to run `npm run dev` or `composer run dev`.

=== laravel/v12 rules ===

# Laravel 12

- CRITICAL: ALWAYS use `search-docs` tool for version-specific Laravel documentation and updated code examples.
- This project upgraded from Laravel 10 without migrating to the new streamlined Laravel file structure.
- This is perfectly fine and recommended by Laravel. Follow the existing structure from Laravel 10. We do not need to migrate to the new Laravel structure unless the user explicitly requests it.

## Laravel 10 Structure

- Middleware typically lives in `app/Http/Middleware/` and service providers in `app/Providers/`.
- There is no `bootstrap/app.php` application configuration in a Laravel 10 structure:
    - Middleware registration happens in `app/Http/Kernel.php`
    - Exception handling is in `app/Exceptions/Handler.php`
    - Console commands and schedule register in `app/Console/Kernel.php`
    - Rate limits likely exist in `RouteServiceProvider` or `app/Http/Kernel.php`

## Database

- When modifying a column, the migration must include all of the attributes that were previously defined on the column. Otherwise, they will be dropped and lost.
- Laravel 12 allows limiting eagerly loaded records natively, without external packages: `$query->latest()->limit(10);`.

### Models

- Casts can and likely should be set in a `casts()` method on a model rather than the `$casts` property. Follow existing conventions from other models.

=== phpunit/core rules ===

# PHPUnit

- This application uses PHPUnit for testing. All tests must be written as PHPUnit classes. Use `php artisan make:test --phpunit {name}` to create a new test.
- If you see a test using "Pest", convert it to PHPUnit.
- Every time a test has been updated, run that singular test.
- When the tests relating to your feature are passing, ask the user if they would like to also run the entire test suite to make sure everything is still passing.
- Tests should cover all happy paths, failure paths, and edge cases.
- You must not remove any tests or test files from the tests directory without approval. These are not temporary or helper files; these are core to the application.

## Running Tests

- Run the minimal number of tests, using an appropriate filter, before finalizing.
- To run all tests: `php artisan test --compact`.
- To run all tests in a file: `php artisan test --compact tests/Feature/ExampleTest.php`.
- To filter on a particular test name: `php artisan test --compact --filter=testName` (recommended after making a change to a related file).
